"""Step Executor.

Executes a single parsed step (see `feature_step_parser`) against a live Selenium
session: resolves the target field via `locator_resolver` (Locator Repository, with
lightweight self-healing fallback), performs the Selenium action with smart waits,
and reports back what locator was used / whether healing occurred so the caller can
persist an `ExecutionStep` (and `HealingHistory`) row.
